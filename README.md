# AI Football - Robomac 2024 @ FEEIT

Together with Natalija Stankoska, we participated in the Robomac 2024 competition held at FEEIT in April 2024.

## Description

In the "AI Agents" category, our objective was to develop three distinct agents to compete in a 3 vs. 3 mini football game against agents from other teams. Our team created three specialized reflex agents, each with a unique role: shooter, goalkeeper, and helper. 

The entire project was developed using Python.
